Audio Synth Project

Create a multi oscillator synthesizer within the Juce framework.

Person 1:
Create a synth framework that will allow us to drag and drop effects into the signal flow of the synth.
Allow effects to be placed in any order after the oscillators.
Create UI elements for the oscillators and DSP effects

Person 2:
Create oscillators! Sine wave, square wave, noise, pulse wave (variable width?), sawtooth wave
At 1-3 oscillators can play at once (more if we have time?)
Create the ability to adjust pitch and volume for each oscillator.
Allow multiple oscillators to play at once.

Person 3:
Create effects! 
Per Oscillator effects (applied directly to the signal generated by each individual oscillator): Envelope generator, Low Frequency Oscillators 
Synth Output effect: Filters (low, high, band), EQ (3 band?), Distortion, Chorus, Envelope generator, Low Frequency Oscillators
    Reuse the Envelope generator and Low Frequency Oscillators effect from the per oscillator effects, but allow it to fit into the drag and drop
    chain of the synth
    
Other:
Setup a way to use a midi keyboard and or your computer's keyboard to provide input to the synth
